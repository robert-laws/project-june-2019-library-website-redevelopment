        h5 Course Reserves Use Policy - For Students
        p The Georgetown University in Qatar Library provides reserve services to ensure access to core course readings that, due to high demand, would not otherwise be available to all students in a class.

        p Students may borrow up to three reserve items at one time. Reserve items are available on a first come, first serve basis. Reserve items cannot be held, recalled, or renewed. To be considerate of other students, please return reserve readings on time.

        h6 Electronic Reserves:
        p Faculty may request that a print copy of materials selected for electronic reserve will remain available at the circulation desk for students to use. The electronic version of those materials will be available via the Web 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for student access.

        h5 Placing Books & Articles on Course Reserves - For Faculty
        p The Georgetown University in Qatar Library provides course reserve services to ensure access to core required class readings that, due to high demand, would not otherwise be available to all students in a class. Reserve services places both books and electronic reserves (e-reserves) materials at your request.

        p Electronic Reserves: There is no limit to the number of core required e-reserves readings a faculty member may have on reserve. Limits apply to the amount of an in-copyright item that may be scanned or photocopied.

          li Single articles from journal issues. Electronic versions will be used whenever possible. If the library does not have the article, we will order a copy.
